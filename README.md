# Tiki_Logistics_Operations_health
- The report laying out some important findings about operations health (on-time delivery, cancellation rate, delivery lead-time, failed delivery, etc).
- Evaluate the failed delivery rate and the reason behind it.
- Evaluate the cancellation rate.
# Some insights found
- The value of canceled orders accounts for more than 35% of the total value. The main reasons for cancellations, with more than 30 thousand orders each, were “not received payment”, “other” and “multiple failed deliveries”.
- The average pick-up time at warehouses 5, 4 and 1 is still quite long. The average packing time at warehouses 4 and 1 is also inefficient => Operations at these warehouses can be improved by increasing the number of staff or automating processes to optimize time.
- Two shipping partners A6 and A5 took more than 100 hours to deliver 1 order while the average delivery time was 31.16 hours. In addition, partners A6 has up to 62.18% of orders delivered late => The company needs to work with these carriers again to achieve better results.
- It can be seen that the longer the delivery time, the higher the order cancellation rate.
